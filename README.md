**Naive Bayes: Applications, Variations and Vulnerabilities - A Review of Literature with implementation code snippets**

By Indika Wickramasinghe and Harsha Kalutarage

The purpose of code snippets provided in this repository is to demonstrate to the reader how a Naive Bayes (NB) classiﬁer can be trained for different applications scenarios (selected) discussed in the paper and its vulnerabilities. Note that building and deploying NB-enabled systems in industry settings would be more complicated than this simpliﬁed examples (toy examples) and such a discussion is out of the scope of this work.
