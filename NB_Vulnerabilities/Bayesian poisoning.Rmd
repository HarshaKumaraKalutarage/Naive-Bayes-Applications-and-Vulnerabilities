The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate to the reader how a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier is vulnerable to Bayesian poisoning attacks. Bayesian poisoning is a technique used by email spammers to compromise the effectiveness of Bayesian based spam filters by adding selected words that are unlikely to appear in a spam message. As a result, the spam filter considers the message to be legitimate - a Type II statistical error. We use the R language in our implementation.
